    "#    linearity may hold.\n",

    "#    How to check: You can check for independence by examining a plot of residuals against the order in which the data was \n",

    "# 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance): The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent \n",

    "#    How to check: Create a scatterplot of residuals against predicted values (Y-hat). If the spread of residuals appears to be\n",

    "# 2. Better Fit: In cases where the true relationship between variables is not linear, polynomial regression can provide a \n",
    "# better fit to the data, resulting in lower residual errors and improved predictive accuracy.\n",

    "# Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression Compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Overfitting: Polynomial regression, especially with high-degree polynomials, is prone to overfitting the data. This means\n",
